# Hunt-and-Cyka
4v1 (Radiant v Dire)

## The concept 

A medium-large sized forest map draped in darkness throughout the entire game. A team of four Snipers are on the hunt for a lone Riki. Snipers spawn at a radiant base, Riki spawns randomly at one of 5 towers dotted throughout the map. There are no lanes in the traditional sense of the word; just pathways carved throughout the forest. Plenty of juking spots, hidden paths & at least 6-7 glades (open areas). 

There are three “rune” spots on the map - in the place of runes are TP scrolls. These are the only consumables in the game. TP scrolls are used to teleport to towers and, in the case of Sniper’s, friendly units (see Sniper ‘R’ ability)

Goal:

* Radiant: hunt Riki and kill him before the timer runs out. 
* Dire: destroy 4 out of the 5 towers before the timer runs out.

## Radiant

Radiant consists of four Snipers with the follow abilities:

#### Q. Rocket Flare

Based on Clockwerk’s “Rocket Flare” ability.

> Fires a global range flare that explodes over a given area, damaging Riki and providing vision of him for 5 seconds and vision over the area for 10.

_Duration_: 5<br/>
_Damage_: 100/120/150/200<br/>

#### W. Scouting Hawk

Based on Beastmaster’s “Call of the Wild” ability.

> Sniper calls for a watchful hawk. It does not reveal invisible units. It’s used for scouting the map and becomes invisible itself after 3 seconds of being motionless. 

_Duration_: 60/80/100/150<br/>
_Cooldown_: 60/80/80/100
